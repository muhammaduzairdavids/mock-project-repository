## Data for Tab Environmental factors
Number of variables: 6
Number of cases/rows: 18


	Column	Variable										Units		Remark

	A	Year of data collection

	B	Mean concentration of chlorophyll a during open-water period (May - October)		µg L-1		The concentration of chlorophyll from 2010 was obtained from monthly integral water column samples (0–7m) collected by Ruttner bottle from May to October. The earlier (2002–2009) data are average annual values accepted from Maximov et al. (2021). In both cases, the concentration of chlorophyll a was measured using standard technique (UNESCO 1966).

	C	Standard error for chlorophyll concenration						µg L-1		Earlier published data of 2002–2009 are presented without standard errors because seasonal data series are not available.

	D	Mean near-bottom (7–8 m) temperature during open-water period (May - October)		°C		Near-bottom (7–8 m) temperature was measured on a biweekly or monthly basis. The mean temperature was calculated by integrating these data.

	E	Minimal near-bottom temperature during open-water period (May - October)		°C		

	F	Maximal near-bottom temperature during open-water period (May - October)		°C
