# Mock Project Repository
This repository contains data and code I used for the Minimal Data Management module *tidy data* deliverable. 

## Navigating the repository
### The Code
The code use for the completion of the deliverable is available in both Rmarkdown format and an .html output. You will be able to download both.  

For the Rmarkdown file click: [mock-dataset.Rmd](https://github.com/muhammaduzairdavids/mock-project-repository/blob/main/mock-dataset.Rmd) 

For the .html output click: [mock-dataset.html](https://github.com/muhammaduzairdavids/mock-project-repository/blob/main/mock-dataset.html)

### The Data
The data used in this mock project is based on data collected by [Maximov (2021)](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.0zpc866z6), and is openly available. The data can be found in the ["data"](https://github.com/muhammaduzairdavids/mock-project-repository/tree/main/data) folder of the repository, and is available for download as three .csv files. Additionally, metadata for the data set is included in the form of a [README.md](https://github.com/muhammaduzairdavids/mock-project-repository/blob/main/data/README.md).

### Binder
This repository is also available on Binder. Binder will allow you to run the code in a virtual machine. To use Binder, follow these steps:

1. Click the following badge: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/muhammaduzairdavids/mock-project-repository/HEAD) and wait for the page to set-up. 
2. Once the page has loaded, click on RStudio in the terminal.
3. Once RStudio has opened in Binder, you can navigate to the `mock-dataset.Rmd` file and run it.

Additionally, a [binder](https://github.com/muhammaduzairdavids/mock-project-repository/tree/main/binder) folder is available on this repository, which contains the files I used to set-up my binder.
